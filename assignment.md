Self-study the following topic categories listed below from this link (https://svelte.dev/examples):

 

* Introduction (all topics)
* Reactivity (all topics)
* Props (all topics)
* Logic (all topics except Await blocks)
* Events (all topics except DOM event forwarding)

 

This is a slightly open-ended assignment. 

How you structure your code is up to you. 

You could create a component for each category and then subcomponents for different topics. 

 

Hand-in: You link to your Git repository to the relevant Svelte project. Create a new one for the assignment.

 

By the end of it you must have code that do the things in each topic “styling/reactivity/props/...” etc….
You are more than welcome to freestyle and play around with these topics and hand that in. In fact, it’s encouraged. 

 

As a note: You could in principle solve the assignment by pasting the code in. 

But personally I learn by writing code myself cause when I make errrors it shows a difference between my own assumptions and how it actually works. When writing the code yourself you should question every part of it and wonder about how it works and experiment with it to test those assumptions. That way you will learn a lot by next week!
